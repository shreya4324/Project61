        <h1> One of My Hobbies: Solving the Rubix Cube</h1>
        <hr>

        <p id="rubixcubep"> One of my favorite hobbies is solving the Rubix Cube. I learned it about a year ago and my fastest record is 1 minute 16 seconds. I got interested in learning how to solve the rubix cube when I went to my aunt and uncle's house. They had a rubix cube that my uncle could solve really quickly. I wanted to learn it too and he taught me. It took me awhile to understand it but I eventually did. I like solving the rubx cube because it is a nice activity to do when you are bored or really tired. </p>

            The Tale of the Missing Mint at the Montana Museum
            <p />
        <p class="pinstory">
            Chapter 1:
            It was 8 a.m. in Montana City and the sun was shining, Emma and Olivia were on a walk, the two girls were inseparable. They were twin sisters at age 8. Even though they were small, they were amazing at solving mysteries just like real detectives. Their best quality was that they were kind and helped anyone in need no matter what. Every morning at 8 a.m. they would go for a run through different cities. It would last about 1 hr each day. The girls went to a school called Montana City Elementary School. They would wake up at 5:30 and get dressed to go for their run. They were very punctual on time and disliked being late.
            A while later, when they were on their way home they saw someone yelling HELP ME! The girls stopped to see what was wrong. The man replied that a very famous artifact called The Mint" was missing from the museum! The mint was carved beautifully thousands of years ago. The Montana Museum of Arts and Culture's most famous exhibit was The Mint. Thousands of people came to see it everyday, but now it was missing!
            The girls were shocked. The man was so sad that they couldn't help it. They said they would try to find the thief. After coming home from school that day, without wasting any time they got to work. The man gave them some magnifying glasses. They started to look for some footprints. After searching for a long time Emma's friend came walking by. Her name was Lila and Emma told her that they were helping to find the thief who stole The Mint from the museum. A while later Olivia told Emma that she saw an afraid look on Lila’s face. It was getting dark and they hadn't found anything. Olivia promised that she and Emma would come again tomorrow.
            The next day they found a note which said " Give me food and I will live, give me water and I will die. What am I ?" I think our thief was trying to find something and this is the clue to finding the next thing. We have to solve this. said Emma It is our only hope. </p>
        <p class="pinstory">

            Chapter 2:
            Emma and Olivia were up all night trying to solve the riddle. Finally they said "fire!" If we give the fire food it will grow. If we give it water it will go away. Now we have to think of something related to fire. "Since it has food and water in the riddle maybe it has something to do with that." said Olivia You may be right, because there is a restaurant named the Fire Pit Pizza. said Emma They decided to go there tomorrow.
            Saturday mornings were the best, you got to hang out all day and sleep in late but today the sisters had a mission, so they went to the restaurant to check it out, but there was a problem. Their little sister is 5 years old and their parents need to go somewhere. Olivia and Emma have to look after their little sister, Mia. Why don't we take her with us Olivia? suggested Emma. They both agreed and thought it was a good idea. As soon as Mia, Emma and Olivia reached Fire Pit Pizza, Mia started begging for some cheese pizza. They had $10 so they decided to buy her one. That way she won't bug them, the pizza cost $7 so they had enough money. After Mia took one bite, guess what? She dropped the whole pizza on the ground and then she started crying like a two-year-old! Everyone in the restaurant was staring at Mia, Emma and Olivia. They didn't have enough money to buy her another pizza but they bought Mia a cookie for $3. Just then, something super weird happened. A mailman came and gave them a letter. He didn't say a word, all he did was that he handed them the letter and walked away as if he was a robot without saying a word. The girls opened up the letter. You would not be able to guess what was inside it. </p>
        <p class="pinstory">
            Chapter 3:
            There was another question inside the letter. It said "What has all the letters in the world?" Since a mailman gave it to us, maybe it has something to do with a post office, said Emma "Post office." That’s it. A post office has all the letters in the world. Think about it. It could be letters as in mail instead of the alphabet." After a lot of discussion Olivia was finally convinced.
            It was getting late but they tried to make it to the post office. When they finally got there it was closed. They were very tired and decided to check it out tomorrow. They had lots of things to do so they didn’t get time but a couple of days later they decided to finally go see it. They had a school play about the American history and had completely forgotten! They were in the same class which is good for inseparable sisters. Just when they were about to leave for the Post Office their parents called and asked "Are you ready to go or not? What's taking so long?" "Go where?" the girls called back. "The play." their dad replied. They quickly got dressed and went to school. It meant they would have to wait until later in the day. At the play the sisters saw something sticking out of Lila's bag. But no time for that. The show was starting, Emma and Olivia were amazing! They stole the show. The play had lasted until 3 p.m. so they didn't have much time to investigate.
            At the post office a man gave them a stamp which had a picture of a park. It was very weird that the man knew what they needed. The girls quickly left the post office because they still needed to get to the park. At the park Lila was playing with the mint! Emma and Olivia quickly got out of there. There was so much to think about, but the number one question was why would Lila take the mint? That night the girls couldn't sleep. They were twisting and turning the whole night but they found out that the thing that was sticking out of Lila’s bag at the play was The Mint. She must have been carrying it around with her so no one could take it back. Emma thought of a plan that would trick Lila into giving them the mint but she felt bad doing it. In fact they both did, they have always been so generous but they had to. It was the only way and this included Lila’s impression. Lila cared most about her impression.</p>

            Chapter 4:
            The next day, Emma called Lila and told her that she and Oliva wanted to have a picnic with her. At lunch time they got there and Lila’s face was all red like she had been crying. They asked Lila what was wrong but she ignored it like she hadn't heard them. Then they saw The Mint sticking out of her bag and asked her calmly what was in it. She decided to show them The Mint and said "This is a toy that I had since I was three. It is very special to me because I got it from the museum." As soon as she started showing it to them Mia came in and took a picture of her. In seconds, Emma started scolding her that this is a very irresponsible thing to do and they would show the picture to the whole school unless she returned the mint to them. The sisters disliked blackmailing her but she left them no choice. Even though they were kind, they just didn’t like the way Lila had done something bad and was afraid to admit it. She had tried to cover up her tracks and get away with it. Olivia thought that Lila did a horrible thing but decided not to say it because she was pretty sure that Lila figured that out by now. When Lila told them what had happened they found out what she did and why. Lila told the girls that she went to the museum on Thursday and had seen The Mint exhibit. She saw how beautiful it was and wanted it so she took it. "I was so scared to return it that I made chits with clues in them that would lead to me. The mailman that gave you the letter and the stamp was my dad’s friend. I didn’t tell him my true intentions. My parents had scolded me that night so I had to return it no matter what. I felt so guilty and sad like someone had punched me in the stomach. I am so sorry. Can you please return The Mint for me?" She asked After hearing her story Emma, Olivia and Mia kind of felt sorry for her. They decided to forgive her but she had to return The Mint herself.
            They decided to eat lunch since everyone was starving like they had been on an airplane for 24 hours and would take care of the situation later. They were joking around and they were feeling happy. Mia said "OY-HOOVE-IK-WHEN-EFRYON-ISH-HOPPY!" Emma figured out what she said but the rest were puzzled. She said " I love it when everyone is happy!" but you couldn’t understand it because she was eating her sandwich. Later in the day Lila had made an apology note and gave the note and The Mint to the owner. She started crying but the man was nice so he forgave her. Ever since they lived happily ever after.
